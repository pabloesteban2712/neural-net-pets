## Dog vs Cat Classifier
This project uses Python and TensorFlow to create a neural network that can distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on a dataset of images and learns to classify whether an image contains a dog or a cat.

# Requirements
Before you start, make sure to install the required libraries:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Dataset
This model is trained using the Dogs vs. Cats dataset available from Kaggle. 
The dataset consists of 25,000 labeled images of dogs and cats.

## Model Architecture
The neural network used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The model architecture is simple but effective, consisting of several convolutional layers followed by dense layers.

## Results
After training, the model can predict whether a given image contains a dog or a cat. The output will show the predicted class along with the confidence score.
